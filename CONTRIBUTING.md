# Contributing Guidelines

## Introduction

Thanks for wanting to contribute to `react-native-exact-target`!  We're looking to constantly improve this library and expose the SFMC community to the wonderful React Native community.

Please follow the guidelines below.  If you have any questions, please reach out to me at [@grales on Twitter](https://twitter.com/grales).

## Local Development

1. Open a terminal
1. `mkdir react-native-exact-target-dev`
1. `cd react-native-exact-target-dev && git clone https://github.com/ericnograles/react-native-exact-target.git && git clone https://github.com/ericnograles/react-native-exact-target-example-app.git && cd react-native-exact-target-example-app && git checkout local_development && yarn install` 

**Note**: Symlinks don't play well with React Native, so for every change in `react-native-exact-target` you will need to re-run `yarn install` in `react-native-exact-target-example-app`

2. Create a feature branch off of `master` and perform the work you'd like.
3. Create a Pull Request back to this repo's `master`
4. The PR should follow the [PR_TEMPLATE.MD](PR_TEMPLATE.MD) format

## Help Wanted: Core Contributors

As I can only maintain this in my limited spare time, I would love some help from some core contributors, especially if you happen to work for SFMC :smile:  

Please shoot me a message on Twitter and we'll get you the proper access to this repo.
